# Star Gazer

Star Gazer is a web app that uses the National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA) Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API to allow users to query the NASA APOD database using a date-range (i.e. a start-date and and end-date); pictures falling within the date-range are returned in a list format, along with their respective dates, titles, and descriptions.

Users are then able to add selected results to a "favorites-list" and  re-visit or edit saved entries as they please.

## Getting Started

Just enter a start date and and end date and hit the 'Get APOD!' button to return all APOD entries within the date range.

Click the 'Add' button at the bottom of each returned result to save the entry in question to your 'Favourites' list.

Click on the 'Favourites' link on the Navbar to access all previously saved entries.

### Prerequisites

### How to Use
